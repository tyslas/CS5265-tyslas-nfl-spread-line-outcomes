        "### Background\n",
        "I enjoy watching the NFL and playing fantasy football. I also like to place bets on games using apps like FanDuel. The purpose of this project is to increase my understanding of the NFL betting market and possibly create a machine learning model to give myself an edge next season.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Project Description\n",
        "I found a dataset from Kaggle titled [NFL scores and betting data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data?resource=download). This dataset has over 13,000 samples and 17 features. The goal is to use this dataset to train a model that will predict the winner of a given game.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Metric\n",
        "For my performance metric, I will aim for the model to have at least 70% accuracy."
